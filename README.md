<h1>Brygada 1918</h1>

<h5>Description</h5>
Brygada 1918 is a digital revival project created for the celebration of 100 years of independance of the Republic of Poland in 2018. The typeface is based on the catalogue entry of the National Type Foundry from 1954 and a set of matrices found at the Book Arts Museum by mr. Janusz Tryzno in 2016. The original styles included Regular, Italics, and Bold in a range of sizes.

<h5>Expansion</h5>
The initial revival project, which went on from Jan to May 2018, refined the design for contemporary needs and expanded the style range with SemiBold, SemiBold Italics, and Bold Italics, to a total of 6 instances. We also broadened the character set to cover the majority of Latin Script Languages. The second expansion was done in October 2018 and included Cyrillic, International Phonetic Alphabet, and Greek scripts. The typeface has sub and superscript numbers and alphabetic characters, Old Style and Proportial figures (both also available in Tabular version), Case Sensitive characters, and a range of functional and decorative extra characters.

Second stage of the project included a publication on the research and process, as well as a website that contains documentation and information about Brygada.

Thanks to support of Google Brygada 1918 was further expanded in 2020 with Vietnamese diacritics and adapted for Variable technology. [Brygada 1918 on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Brygada+1918).
