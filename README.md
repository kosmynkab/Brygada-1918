<h1>Brygada 1918</h1>

<h5>Description</h5>
Brygada 1918 is a digital revival project created for the celebration of 100 years of independance of the Republic of Poland in 2018. The typeface is based on the catalogue entry of the National Type Foundry from 1954 and a set of matrices found at the Book Arts Museum by mr. Janusz Tryzno in 2016. The original styles included Regular, Italics, and Bold in a range of sizes.

<h5>Expansion</h5>
The initial revival project, which went on from Jan to May 2018, refined the design for contemporary needs and expanded the style range with SemiBold, SemiBold Italics, and Bold Italics, to a total of 6 instances. We also broadened the character set to cover the majority of Latin Script Languages. The second expansion was done in October 2018 and included Cyrillic, International Phonetic Alphabet, and Greek scripts. The typeface has sub and superscript numbers and alphabetic characters, Old Style and Proportial figures (both also available in Tabular version), Case Sensitive characters, and a range of functional and decorative extra characters.

Second stage of the project included a publication on the research and process, as well as a website that contains documentation and information about Brygada.
More info available on the [project website](https://brygada1918.eu/?lang=en).

Thanks to support of Google Brygada 1918 was further expanded in 2020 with Vietnamese diacritics and adapted for Variable technology. [Brygada 1918 on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Brygada+1918).

<h5>Build the fonts<h5>
  
When you push modifications in the sources directory on the main branch, github will perform some actions on these changes: It builds the fonts for you and check with Fontbakery if the builds pass Google Fonts Quality Assurance Checks. If you want to download the package containg the fonts and the report, got to the [Action tab](https://github.com/kosmynkab/Brygada-1918/actions), click on the last action (which carries the name of your last commit) and there you will find a package to download (Brygada1918_Fonts) in the "Artifacts" section.

If you want to build the font locally. First, install `gftools` in a virtual environment (anywhere but preferably in your local repo, and not in icloud):

```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install gftools
```

Then, you can build the fonts with this command:
```
$ cd path/to/sources
$ gftools builder config.yaml
```

Make sure you always activate the virtual env before hand each time you want to build (`$ source env/bin/activate`)
