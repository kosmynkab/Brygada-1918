<p><b>Brygada 1918</b> is a digital revival project of Brygada typeface created thatnks to the 
support of the "Indepenedent" program, the President of the Republic of Poland, and now Google Fonts. The 
source of inspiration lies in casting matrices found by Janusz Pawel Tryzno in the 
Book Art Museum in Lodz. Extended Brygada 1918 family, including 6 instances was just updated and now includes: 
Extended Latin (including Vietnamese), Cyrillic, Greek, and IPA - the phonetic alphabet.</p>
<br>
<p>We hope that through its use the Brygada 1918 project will benefit the building common conscience of 
type design and it's history in Poland.</p>
